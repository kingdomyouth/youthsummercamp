              <p>on the first day we where told to write our questions/expectation,
                 i thought at first this was a bit ridiculous, but i was proven wrong with every question that was answered.
                 God not only answered my pointless questions but also managed to answer what was trully in my heart. For most of my life
                 as a christian i wasnt able to loudly pray in tounges. every time i tried i would literaly choke and i felt like i was on
                 the verge of death, but during these past six days i finally was able to shout it out.</p>

              <p> God has honestly changed my life for the better, during these past six days i was constantly reminded that i was loved,
                and honestly i havent felt that way in a really long time. All i have to say is that God loves us, not because we 
                loved him first, but because he is who he is.

              <p>when i was younger i had the desire to hold Gods hand,i would usually leave a spot for him when i sat 
                and i just really wanted Gods presence. This summer camp i felt Jesus holding our hands, and we truly felt his presence.

              <p>basically, before this i couldn't speak in tongues, but after one of the prayer sessions,
                i just opened my mouth and the Holy spirit spoke through me. whenever i speak in tongues, i feel 
               as though my body is not my own. There's just this warmth i feel radiationg through my entire body.

              <p>For a while i didnt know who i was and i didnt think i had a purpose, you lose track of who you are 
                and what you are ment to do; thats when you lose your connection with God, you forget how loving
                and merciful he is. withthis summer camp i remebered him and now i know him better than ever.

              <p> My relationship with God has increased in a dynamic manner. I have felt him, i have heard his undeniable voice, and most importantly
                i know he loves me. I have finally learnt that true Eternal life is not living for ever but my relationship with God.
